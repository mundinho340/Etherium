// Unsigned Integers

// What the heck is an unsigned integer?

// First, let's go over integers. Integers include all positive and negative numbers without fractions. The numbers -2,-1,0,1,2 are all integers. This range continues in both the positive and negative direction as far as you can count!

// To determine if the number is above or below zero we use the sign: + or -. An unsigned integer is an integer that has no sign.

// Solidity has a specific data type for unsigned integers called uint. A uint can be suffixed with the number of bits reserved for it. For instance uint8 means that there are eight bits provided for the value of the variable.

// What is the range of unsigned integers in eight bits?

// Eight bits can range from 00000000 to 11111111. This range can represent 256 unique values.

// Since the range of unsigned integer values does not include negative numbers, it is simply 0 to 255. In decimal, the unsigned value of 00000000 is 0 and the value of 11111111 is 255.

//     Wondering what happens if we add two uint8 values together whose sum will exceed 255? Let's take a look at this in details.

// Your Goal: Create Unsigned Integers!

// Let's create three public state unsigned integers in our Contract: a, b, and sum.

//     Define the variable a as an uint8 with an initial value between 0 and 255.

//     If you declare the variable a as a uint8 you will actually be unable to store a value outside the range 0 to 255. If you try this directly in your program, you'll get a comrpile-time error!

//     Define the variable b as an uint16 with a value of at least 256. The range for a uint16 is 0 to 65535.

//     The variable sum should be a uint256 with the sum of the values stored in a and b.

//     It's perfectly valid to add a uint8 and a uint16 and store them in a uint256. Mix it up!

// In Solidity we can use the same math operators we've become familiar with from JavaScript +, -, *, /. % and **.

//     You can use uint256 or uint to declare the sum. The keyword uint is an alias for uint256 and it is often used!
