/**
Signer

We've talked about the signer quite a bit in the past few stages, but what is it, exactly?

A signer represents an EOA we have control over. We can use it to sign transactions before sending them to the network.

When we create a Contract instance we connect with a signer so that we can transact with the contract easily!

We can also connect the contract with other signers when we need to run the same transaction with different addresses:

// createUsers.js
async function createUsers(contract, signers) {
    for(let i = 0; i < signers.length; i++) {
        await contract.connect(signers[i]).createUser();
    }
}

In this example we are connecting the contract with different signers and calling the createUser method with each one.

    The function connect returns a new instance of contract connected with this signer. This makes it possible to "chain" the function with the method call to createUser as shown above. Each call will be made with a different signer.

The msg.sender value inside the contract will be the address of these users:

// Contract.sol
import "hardhat/console.sol";
contract Contract {
    function createUser() external view {
        console.log(msg.sender); // 0xabcâ€¦
    }
}

The createUser function will be called once for each signer in the signers array.
Your Goal: Set Message

    In the Contract you will find a message state variable. Your goal is to modify the message to contain anything other than an empty string.
    The only problem is the owner cannot change this message! You'll need to connect the contract to a different signer in order to change it. In the index.js file you'll have access to the contract and a different signer.

 * Set the message on the contract using the signer passed in
 *
 * @param {ethers.Contract} contract - ethers.js contract instance
 * @param {ethers.types.Signer} signer - ethers.js signer instance
 * @return {promise} a promise of transaction modifying the `message`
 */
async function setMessage(contract, signer) {
    
    await contract.connect(signer).modify("Medx is a revolution");
    
}

module.exports = setMessage;
