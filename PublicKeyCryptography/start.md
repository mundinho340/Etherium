#Public Key Cryptography

##Let's learn public key cryptography by applying it!

##In this series of exercises we will be focused on Public Key Cryptography with ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). 
###The specific algorithm we will use is secp256k1, which is the curve used for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. 
###This set of code exercises will be instrumental towards understanding how we can use public key cryptography throughout the rest of the course.
###You will learn how to sign a hashed message, recover the public key from the signature and transform the public key into the user's ethereum address.

###These concepts will help us understand how the blockchain protocol works and provide us with the tools to use digital signature authentication when we need to prove a user's intention. This will be crucial knowledge when building applications interacting with blockchain as well as smart contracts on the blockchain.
