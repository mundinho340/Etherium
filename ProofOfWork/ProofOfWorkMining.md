Proof of Work Miner

We're going to build a basic proof of work miner!

This miner will receive transactions from the network and add them to its mempool.

When a block is ready to be mined, the miner will take those transactions from the mempool and include them into the mined block.

The miner will also calculate a basic proof of work below a constant TARGET_DIFFICULTY.
